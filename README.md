## About this repository

A Binder-compatible repo with an `environment.yml` file copied from https://github.com/binder-examples/conda

### Notes

The `environment.yml` file should list all Python libraries on which your notebooks
depend, specified as though they were created using the following `conda` commands:

```
conda activate playground-environment
conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml
```

Note that the only libraries available to you will be the ones specified in
the `environment.yml`, so be sure to include everything that you need!
